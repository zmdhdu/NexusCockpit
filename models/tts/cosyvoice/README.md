## Highlight🔥

**Fun-CosyVoice 3.0** is an advanced text-to-speech (TTS) system based on large language models (LLM), surpassing its predecessor (CosyVoice 2.0) in content consistency, speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. It is designed for zero-shot multilingual speech synthesis in the wild.
### Key Features
- **Language Coverage**: Covers 9 common languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian), 18+ Chinese dialects/accents (Guangdong, Minnan, Sichuan, Dongbei, Shan3xi, Shan1xi, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Ningxia, Gansu, etc.) and meanwhile supports both multi-lingual/cross-lingual zero-shot voice cloning.
- **Content Consistency & Naturalness**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in content consistency, speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness.
- **Pronunciation Inpainting**: Supports pronunciation inpainting of Chinese Pinyin and English CMU phonemes, providing more controllability and thus suitable for production use.
- **Text Normalization**: Supports reading of numbers, special symbols and various text formats without a traditional frontend module.
- **Bi-Streaming**: Support both text-in streaming and audio-out streaming, and achieves latency as low as 150ms while maintaining high-quality audio output.
- **Instruct Support**: Supports various instructions such as languages, dialects, emotions, speed, volume, etc.

## Install

### Clone and install

- Clone the repo
    ``` sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice.git
    # If you failed to clone the submodule due to network failures, please run the following command until success
    cd CosyVoice
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

- Install Conda: please see https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- Create Conda env:

    ``` sh
    conda create -n cosyvoice -y python=3.10
    conda activate cosyvoice
    pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host=mirrors.aliyun.com

    # If you encounter sox compatibility issues
    # ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install sox libsox-dev
    # centos
    sudo yum install sox sox-devel
    ```

### Model download

``` python
from modelscope import snapshot_download
snapshot_download('iic/CosyVoice-300M', local_dir='pretrained_models/CosyVoice-300M')
snapshot_download('iic/CosyVoice-ttsfrd', local_dir='pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd')
```

Optionally, you can unzip `ttsfrd` resource and install `ttsfrd` package for better text normalization performance.

Notice that this step is not necessary. If you do not install `ttsfrd` package, we will use wetext by default.

``` sh
cd pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd/
unzip resource.zip -d .
pip install ttsfrd_dependency-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
pip install ttsfrd-0.4.2-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Basic Usage

``` python
import sys
sys.path.append('third_party/Matcha-TTS')
from cosyvoice.cli.cosyvoice import AutoModel
import torchaudio

""" CosyVoice Usage, check https://fun-audio-llm.github.io/ for more details
"""
cosyvoice = AutoModel(model_dir='pretrained_models/CosyVoice-300M')
# zero_shot usage
for i, j in enumerate(cosyvoice.inference_zero_shot('收到好友从远方寄来的生日礼物，那份意外的惊喜与深深的祝福让我心中充满了甜蜜的快乐，笑容如花儿般绽放。', '希望你以后能够做的比我还好呦。', './asset/zero_shot_prompt.wav')):
    torchaudio.save('zero_shot_{}.wav'.format(i), j['tts_speech'], cosyvoice.sample_rate)
# cross_lingual usage, <|zh|><|en|><|jp|><|yue|><|ko|> for Chinese/English/Japanese/Cantonese/Korean
for i, j in enumerate(cosyvoice.inference_cross_lingual('<|en|>And then later on, fully acquiring that company. So keeping management in line, interest in line with the asset that\'s coming into the family is a reason why sometimes we don\'t buy the whole thing.',
                                                        './asset/cross_lingual_prompt.wav')):
    torchaudio.save('cross_lingual_{}.wav'.format(i), j['tts_speech'], cosyvoice.sample_rate)
# vc usage
for i, j in enumerate(cosyvoice.inference_vc('./asset/cross_lingual_prompt.wav', './asset/zero_shot_prompt.wav')):
    torchaudio.save('vc_{}.wav'.format(i), j['tts_speech'], cosyvoice.sample_rate)
```
